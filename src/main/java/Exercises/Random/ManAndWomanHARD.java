4. Create two objects of each class with complete data using a constructor.
5. Display the objects on the screen in this format: name + " " + age + " " + address


Requirements:
1. In the Solution class, create a public static Man class.
2. In the Solution class, create a public static Woman class.
3. The Man class must have variables: String name, int age, and String address.
4. The Woman class must have variables: String name, int age, and String address.
5. The Man and Woman classes must have constructors that take String, int, and String arguments.
